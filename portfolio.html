                        <li>The user can upload a JPG, PPM, PNG, or BMP file, then apply a variety of image processing commands onto the image, including 
                            brighten/darken, greyscale, horizontal/vertical flip, filter, blur, and sharpen. The user can then save the file to a location of their 
                            choosing as one of the aforementioned file types. 
                        </li>
