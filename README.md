# Personal-Website

**Description**<br /> 
- This is a simple website I designed as a way to present both myself and my work. Here, you can find a few different pages, 
including a home page, an about page, a portfolio page, and a contact page, all of which can be easily accessed via the naviagation 
bar on the left-hand side of the website. 
- Visit the about page to learn more about me as a person, particularly in regards to how I spend my free time. 
- Visit the portfolio page to learn more about coding projects I have completed. I highlight a few projects from class, as well 
as the personal projects I have completed. 
- Visit the contact page for my contact information and important links. 
- I began this project in January of 2021 as a way to explore my curiosity in web development, so I used HTML and CSS. While my website 
is fairly simple, there are plenty of opportunities for me to improve the site and add additional features. I plan on continually updating it as I learn more and complete new personal projects.  

**How to Access**<br />
- The website is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed at https://abbyhofmann.github.io.
